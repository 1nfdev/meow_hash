# Meow hash 0.5/calico
This is the official x64 implementation of the Meow hash, a fast non-cryptographic hash.  See https://mollyrocket.com/meowhash for usage, implementation, and license details.

This version is v0.5 and is PREPARING FOR FINALIZATION.  Please provide as much testing, analysis, and commentary on the hash function as you can.  If we cannot substantially improve the hash function from here, this will be the final construction.

This version builds on Windows/MSVC and Windows/CLANG, and supports x64 AES-NI processors.
