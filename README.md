# Meow hash
This is the official x64 implementation of the Meow hash, an extremely fast non-cryptographic hash.  See https://mollyrocket.com/meowhash for usage, implementation, and license details.

This version is v0.2 and is EXPERIMENTAL.  It is only designed for testing and comment right now.  Updates will be coming which finalize the hash function, but for right now it is still considered in flux.  Thsi version builds on Windows/MSVC and Linux/CLANG.  A Mac buildable version will be forthcoming.
