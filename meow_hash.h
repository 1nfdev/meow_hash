   FAQ
   
   Q: What is it?
   A: Meow is a 128-bit non-cryptographic hash that operates at high speeds
      on x64 processors.  It is designed to be truncatable to 256, 128, 64,
      and 32-bit hash values and still retain good collision resistance.
      
   Q: What is it GOOD for?
   A: Quickly hashing large amounts of data for comparison purposes such as
      block deduplication or file verification.  As of its publication in
      October of 2018, it was the fastest hash in the smhasher suite by
      a factor of 3, but it still passes all smhasher tests and has not
      yet produced any spurious collisions in practical deployment as
      compared to a baseline of SHA-1.  It is also designed to get faster
      with age: it already contains 256-wide and 512-wide hash-equivalent
      versions that can be enabled for potentially 4x faster performance
      on future VAES x64 chips when they are available.
      
   Q: What is it BAD for?
   A: Anything security-related.  It is not designed for security and has
      not be analyzed for security.  It should be assumed that it offers
      no security whatsoever.  It is also not designed for small input
      sizes, so although it _can_ hash 1 byte, 4 bytes, 32 bytes, etc.,
      it will end up wasting a lot of time on padding since its minimum
      block size is 256 bytes.  Generally speaking, if you're not usually
      hashing a kilobyte or more, this is probably not the hash you're
      looking for.
      
   Q: Who wrote it and why?
   A: It was written by Casey Muratori (https://caseymuratori.com) for use
      in processing large-footprint assets for the game 1935
      (https://molly1935.com).  The original system used an SHA-1 hash
      (which is not designed for speed), and so to eliminate hashing
      bottlenecks in the pipeline, the Meow hash was designed to produce
      equivalent quality 256-bit hash values as a drop-in replacement that
      would take a fraction of the CPU time.
      
   Q: Why is it called the "Meow hash"?
   A: It was created while Meow the Infinite (https://meowtheinfinite.com)
      was in development at Molly Rocket, so there were lots of Meow the
      Infinite drawings happening at that time.
      
   Q: How does it work?
   A: It was designed to be the fastest possible hash that produces
      collision-free hash values in practice and passes standard hash
      quality checks.  It uses the built-in AES acceleration provided by
      modern CPUs and computes sixteen hash streams in parallel to avoid
      serial dependency stalls.  The sixteen separate hash results are
      then hashed themselves to produce the final hash value.  While only
      four hash streams would suffice for maximum performance on today's
      machines, hypothetical future chips will likely want sixteen.
      Meow was designed to be future-proof by using sixteen streams up
      front, so in the 2020 time frame when such chips start appearing,
      wider execution of Meow can be enabled without needing to change
      any persistent hash values stored in codebases, databases, etc.
      
   ========================================================================
   
   COMPILATION
   
   To use the Meow hash, #include meow_hash.h in a single CPP file in your
   C++ project.  This will include the entire implementation.  You can
   then define your own thunk calls in that file, and define a header file
   with the API of your choice.
   
   It is NOT recommended to expose the Meow hash API directly to the rest
   of your program, because it must return the hash result as a
   non-C-standard type (since the values are SSE/AVX-512/etc.), and your
   project will likely have its own types defined for these.  So at the
   very least, you will want to make a thunk call that wraps the Meow hash
   with a conversion to your preferred 128/256/512-bit type.
   
   If your compiler is older, and has trouble compiling code for AVX-512,
   you can turn off the AVX-512 paths in Meow hash with a #define:
   
       #define MEOW_HASH_AVX512 0
       
   You can place this before you include meow_hash.h, or you can put
   it in the compiler options for your compiler to define it automatically.
   
   If you need Meow to use different types than the default for u8, u32,
   u64, and
   
   **** VERY IMPORTANT COMPILATION NOTE ****
   
   Meow uses the AESDEC instruction, which comes in two flavors:
   SSE (aesdec) and AVX (vaesdec).  If you are compiling _with_ AVX support,
   your compiler will probably emit the AVX variant, which means your code
   WILL NOT RUN on computers that do not have AVX.  If you need to deploy
   this hash on computers that do not have AVX, you must take care to
   TURN OFF support for AVX in your compiler for the file that includes
   the Meow hash!
   
   ========================================================================
   
   USAGE
   
   For a complete working example, see meow_example.cpp.
   
   In order to use the Meow hash, you must have x64 intrinsics defined.
   This requires including a compiler-specific intrinsics file, such as:
   
       #ifdef _MSC_VER
       #include <intrin.h>
       #else
       #include <x86intrin.h>
       #endif
       
   Once you have intrinsics defined, to hash a block of data,
   call a MeowHash implementation:
   
       #include "meow_hash.h"
       
       // NOTE(casey): Source MUST be aligned to MEOW_HASH_ALIGNMENT
       // if you are not compiling for platforms with AVX support!
       
       // Always available
       meow_lane MeowHash1(u64 Seed, u64 Len, void *Source);
       
       // Available only when compiling with AVX extensions
       meow_lane MeowHash2(u64 Seed, u64 Len, void *Source);
       meow_lane MeowHash4(u64 Seed, u64 Len, void *Source);
       
   MeowHash1 is 128-bit wide AES-NI.  MeowHash2 is 256-bit wide VAES.
   MeowHash4 is 512-bit wide VAES.  As of the initial publication of
   Meow hash, no consumer CPUs exist which support VAES, so these
   are for future use and internal x64 vendor testing.
   
   Calling MeowHash* with a seed, length, and source pointer invokes the
   hash and returns a meow_lane union which contains the 128-bit result
   accessible in a number of ways (u32[4], u64[2], _m128i).  From there
   you can pull out what you want and discard the rest, as the Meow hash
   is designed to produce high-quality hashes when truncated down to
   anything 32 bits or greater.
 
   Since no currently available CPUs can run MeowHash2 or MeowHash4,
   it is not recommended that you include them in your code, because
   they literally _cannot_ be tested.  Once CPUs are available that
   can run them, you can include them and use a probing function
   to see if they can be used at startup, as shown in meow_example.cpp.
   
   **** VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMMING NOTE ****
   
   If you are compiling with AES-NI (not AVX), the source pointer to
   MeowHash1 _must_ be aligned to the byte boundary specified by the
   #define MEOW_HASH_ALIGNMENT, or Meow hash may fault with an
   unaligned load.
   
   Because MeowHash2 and MeowHash4 are AVX-512 only, they do not have
   these limitations, because they _cannot_ be compiled in non-AVX
   modes.  So if you can run MeowHash2 and MeowHash4 at all, you can
   run them on unaligned buffers just fine.
   
   TL;DR: If you don't know what AES-NI, VAES, VEX, etc. are, then just
   always align your buffers :)  It's not hard to do, and it will
   avoid you accidentally shipping code that crashes with unaligned
   load exceptions.
